# Examples of usage

I haven't properly created good examples of this library (since that takes time, and I am very busy). However, I have used it quite a bit in various school projects, which are listed below.

The versions of `ctty` in these projects might be old, but aside from changes in filesystem structure (the things you'll have to #include are different) the library has not changed a lot (and is not anticipated to do so in future).

[Battleship](https://github.com/chickenspaceprogram/Boose_PA6) - An implementation of the game Battleship. The code for this is pretty cursed due to poor planning and time constraints, however, it does show the usage of various parts of this library.

[Poker](https://github.com/chickenspaceprogram/Boose_PA7) - An implementation of Poker. Doesn't use this library as heavily as Battleship.
